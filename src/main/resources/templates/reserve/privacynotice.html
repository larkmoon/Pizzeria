When you use our reservation or online ordering system to make a reservation with a restaurant (including making a reservation request) or to make an online order with a restaurant, we provide certain aspects of your information to the restaurant necessary for the restaurant to handle your request, including your name, date and time of your reservation or online order, contact details, and any other information you include when submitting the reservation or online order request. Restaurants with which we share your information may, in turn, share your information with their affiliates and service providers in order to provide you with the best customer experience, in the same way as they might share your information had you reserved or ordered with the restaurant directly.
